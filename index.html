          Siberian tigers are incredibly solitary animals. They are extremely
          territorial and do not like to be around other tigers. Their
          territories are marked by spraying, and some of their territories can
          cover hundreds of square miles. Siberian tigers are also excellent
          swimmers, and they often traverse rivers and streams in search of prey
          such as deer and wild boar.
